Calibrate Optitrack
Clear all objects from environment
Perform wanding calibration (view->Calibration asset)
Set ground plane
Hold x-axis pinting into sawyer pedastal base with z axis pointing to left (if facing sawyer). 
See instecutions on ground plane object
Once set, in Set Ground Plane view, rotate +90 degrees around x once.
View data assets (view->assets)
ADd remove assets as desired
To add, highlight the markers of interest in the visualzation in Motive. Right click and add rigid body.
To remove, right click on a marker of an existing bodyh in visualzation and remove.
Use launch file in Repo: Cairo_lfd Folder lfd_experiments:launch:cairo_lfd.launch
roslaunch lfd_experiments cairo_lfd.launch
This will launch/run:
joint_trajectory_action_server
sawyer_moveit
tf_visual_tools_publisher (requires tf_visual_tools_package)
transform_lookup_service (requires package cairo-robot-interface package)
vrpn.launch (requires both cairo-robot-interface AND vrpn_client_ros)
Be sure to install all the required dependencies.
Lookup tf_visual_tools_publisher online to see hwo to get it visible in RVIZ.
If installed properly, it should just require you to to to Panels->New Panel->tfVisualTools in RVIZ
Create your intial transform: FROM: world TO: optitrack_world
Make the gripper cuff controllable
rosrun intera_examples gripper_cuff_control.py=
Create reference rigid body
Make a rigid body of one of the 6 pronged calibration item and call is something similar to gripper tip.
In RVIZ, in Dispalys, add TF and makes sure in the Frames that the right_gripper_tip is selected
Tweak your initial transformation using the 'manipulate' tab of TFVisualTools panel to align as best you possibly can, the optitrack gripper object and the right_gripper_tip. 
Save this calibration
