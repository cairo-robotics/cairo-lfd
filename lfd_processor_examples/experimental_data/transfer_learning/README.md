By introducing 1 "gold example" of a new demonstration with a new constraint configuration, the previous demosntrations do not interfere with the correct behavior.

Without explicitly showing this one new demonstration, and simply switch9ing the config files that define the constraints for validation checking of points, the system does nto adapt. 

This is likely due to the face that the new demosntration provides just enough data such that the new distributions for each keyframe has enough variation such that correctly constrained keyframe waypoints are sampled.
